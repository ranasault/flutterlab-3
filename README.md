My classmate dipanshu helped me in this lab and i also took help form Online sources.

The automated image rotation technique of this Android app rotates graphics every ten seconds. Additionally, it has a Pause/Resume button that lets users adjust the rotation.
Features include a 10-second automatic image rotation. To control visual transitions, use the Pause and Resume features. For fluid picture changes, use a smooth fade-in animation.

Improvements: For improved control, I added a Pause/Resume button and created the logic for image rotation in this project. In order to guarantee seamless image transitions, I also used a fade-in effect. To manage image switching and user interactions, the MainActivity.kt file underwent the most significant changes.
Acknowledgments: The Android Developers Documentation and Stack Overflow provided me with valuable solutions and insights that helped me finish my project. I also value my friends' constant support and direction during this trip.
